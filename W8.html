    <h3 class="noCenter" id="blogSubHeader">Team work</h3>
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      After our team meeting, we decided to outsource the art assets in our
      game, so I changed the tasks I was working on to make the story scene, so
      the players can know the background story of the game.
    </p>
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      I worked with Dorian, Joshua, and Ethan to brainstorm our story. They
      shared some ideas like time travellers, real railroad history in Cornwall,
      aliens from outer space….etc. I was happy that people were passionate
      about it and in the meantime, they trusted me to write the story. After I
      finished the story, I checked with Ethan to make sure my grammar was good
      and the content in French was correct.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">The story:</p>
    <br />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Players can receive recipes from the future to craft potions. Players
      receive a message: In 2158, the population will reach 500 billion! People
      need to alter their DNA with recipes from the future to make themselves
      smaller so the planet can hold that many people. We need someone to
      concoct these potions now before it is too late!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Then on March 2nd, we had a school trip to Snowed In Studio in Ottawa. We
      met our mentors in person, and we had a really nice meeting talking about
      which direction we should take in our game development. We improved our
      workflow and game design, which meant a lot of things need to be cancelled
      and restarted from scratch. We were glad that finally we knew which way to
      go!

    <h3 class="noCenter" id="blogSubHeader">My work</h3>
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      I added the language Mandarin into our localization system. The issue I
      met was that some characters could not be printed out correctly in the
      game, even after I added the character manually into the fonts, it still
      could not be solved, so I changed the content to avoid using certain words
      to avoid such issues.
    </p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P3.png" alt="Menu with Mandarin" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Another interesting challenge I met while putting Mandarin into the game
      was changing the font. Since when players choose different languages they
      prefer, the font in Mandarin has to be different, so I used a function to
      track all Text Assets in the scene and change its font.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P4.png" alt="Code" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Then I built the story scene. It works as characters show up and tell the
      story. I made a mouth animation, and it will only move when the character
      is still talking and the animation will stop once the character’s line is
      finished.
    </p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P5.png" alt="animation" />
    <br />
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P6.png" alt="animation" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      The lines are going to be shown by typing out.
    </p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P7.png" alt="Code" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      The SentenceBehaviour function is running in a loop. Once a player clicks,
      then moves to the next line or just finishes the line.
    </p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P8.png" alt="Code" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">Check which character is talking.</p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P9.png" alt="Code" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      These four functions are to set the mouth moving animation.
    </p>
    <img id="blogImg" src="./img/Blog/W8P10.png" alt="Code" />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      After the story scene was finished, I jumped into the Jenkins settings. I
      watched some tutorial videos on YouTube before, but this was my first time
      putting the knowledge I learned into practice. Now there are still some
      blocking errors which I don’t know how to solve, but I will keep working
      on it, and I am sure I can figure it out soon.
