    <h3 class="noCenter" id="blogSubHeader">Team work</h3>
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      This week we decided to complete our MVP (minimum viable product). After
      changing the core content of our game, we would like to have our workflow
      in the way as our mentor Matt suggested.
    </p>

    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Stel had strong interest in building the MVP, so I decided to help set up
      the Jenkins system and add some fun features into our game. I discussed it
      with Stel and we agreed to add a mouse popping up feature in the game to
      “annoy” the players. I thought it was a very interesting idea so I
      couldn’t wait to start working on it.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3 class="noCenter" id="blogSubHeader">My work</h3>
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      Before the Jenkins computers were set ready by the IT department, I had
      studied some materials on Google and some tutorials videos on Youtube. I
      thought I finally had a chance to work on Jenkins, and I was ready to put
      what I had learned into practice, but soon I found out I knew too little
      about it. Thanks to the support from people who were also responsible for
      Jenkins from other teams and our professor James, I finally made it work.
      I have learned how to put in the right info into Jenkins and I will
      definitely dive deeper into studying Jenkins build script later.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      After the Jenkins system was set up, I finally started working on the
      mouse popping up feature. I scripted functions to make sure only one
      single mouse will show up and the player has to collide it to eliminate
      the mouse in 5 seconds or there will be punishment, and once the mouse is
      eliminated, the next one will pop up randomly between one to ten seconds.

    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      The punishment will be a canvas getting set active to block the player's
      view.

    <p class="noCenter" id="blogContent">
      After the scripting work was finished, I started the game art part. I
      spent some time looking for inspiration on Google and then started drawing
      on Gimp. I enjoyed the process very much, and I was happy with the work I
      finished.
